The `generate_multi_strat_common_test_NG_flowchart.ipynb` and the `examine_stages_NG_flowchart.ipynb` notebooks
are versions derived from their original versions one directory up, with additional cells
and comments that help determine the number of patients/biopsies in the original, raw Nighingale
cohort as well as the number of excluded and remained patients/biopsies after each filtering step.
The first notebook includes steps 0,1,2 the second notebook includes steps 3,4,5 and using these
5 steps in total, the flowchart for the Nightingale dataset filtering can be constructed.
